# Buckets
Buckets is a fast and light-weight PyQt6 app that manages bucket lists.

Its main features include:

* Create bucket lists as tabs and add items into bucket lists.
* Edit item description and status.
* Move around items for organization.
* share items easily with a single save file.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `python app.py`. Make sure your Python version is 3 and you have PyQt as specificied in `requirements.txt`.

### Future Development

This started as a project to get the hang of PyQt6, while also providing a function that I would use myself.

Some future improvement ideas include:

* Add sorting option to order items alphabetically or via other metrics
* Automatically separate items based on status (i.e. 'Not Started' items are grouped together)
* Ability to add custom properties to items, including links and images
* Styling to make it look less like a default OS app
